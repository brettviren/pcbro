#+title: pcbro: Wire-Cell PCB Anode Readout Package
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: index.html

This Wire-Cell Toolkit (WCT) "user package" provides some Wire-Cell Toolkit components and support code for the PCB anode readout (pcbro) as used in the 50-L test detector and in ongoing DUNE Vertical Drift detector module designs.

Main features:

C++ 
- 50-L detector data decoding (stand-alone)
- WCT component to ingest 50L data

Python module/CLI
- Generate WCT "wires" file for 50-L strips
- Convert GARFIELD 2D responses to WCT format ("2.5D" method)
- Convert 3D responses to WCT format ("3D->2D" method)
- Diagnostic/debugging plots

Jsonnet/JSON
- WCT configuration to run PCB anode data, signal processing, simulation and other WCT jobs.
- Generated WCT wires and response files generated

#+title: Strips and holes
#+subtitle: Field Responses from Francesco Pietropaolo (FP)

* Inputs from FP calculation

FP provides field response calculations using a 3D [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference][finite difference]]
method with boundary conditions provided by a 2D calculation.  The
calculations are performed over a small "rectangle of symmetry" (see
images below) and tabulated for each of 12xN paths.  The 12 span the
equally spaced positions across the strip and which we approximately
identify as WCT impact positions.  The N=4 (induction) and N=6
(collection) points along the strip span the width of the rectangle of
symmetry.  In the process of importing these fields we average over
this direction.  For each position, a response on the central and the
nearest 5 strips is given in the file.

The raw results are downloaded from FP's online store to produce a zip
file holding 48 (induction) or 72 (collection) files named like
~fort.xxx~ with ~xxx=S+i+12*(j-1)~ with ~s=150~ (induction) or ~s=200~
(collection).  Additional ~fort.xxx~ files should be ignored.

Each file is about 4MB with 10 columns:

1. time in microseconds (in steps of 5 ns);
2. x coordinate, x=0 is induction strip center line
3. y coordinate,
4. z coordinate, anti-drift direction
5. current on central strip, 0
6. current on strip +1
7. current on strip +2
8. current on strip +3
9. current on strip +4
10. current on strip +5

Notes from FP:

- The current is given in electron/microseconds and is the one induced by 10^3 electrons

- The electric field used for the calculation is 500 V/cm and the temperature is 87.7 K (both as in the 50 liter TPC). 

- The corresponding drift velocity is obtained with the BNL parametrization (verified as Xin suggested).

- First point is at t=0 and drift location 200mm

- Last point is at t ~ 120us and drift location 16.7mm 

In addition for the collection set:

- In the same dropbox folder there are now the collection signals as well.

- The 72 collection files, numbers from 201 to 272, corresponding to electron trajectories in a 12 x 6 array covering an area of 5 mm (across the strip) x 2.5 mm.

- The normalization is the same (10^3 electrons) as for the induction

- A path equivalence symmetry is exploited as illustrated in:

* Conversion to WCT

For use by WCT simulation and signal processing we produce a JSON file
with field response in WCT system of units and on WCT's convention for
impact position.  Given the ZIP file of ~fort.xxx~ run:

#+begin_example
wirecell-pcbro convert-fpstrips dv-2000v.zip dv-2000v.json.bz2 
#+end_example

A copy of that file is at: https://www.phy.bnl.gov/~bviren/tmp/pcbro/dv-2000v.json.bz2

The WCT "standard" response plot can be made from this file like:

#+begin_example
wirecell-sigproc plot-response --region 0 --trange 0,120 --reflect dv-2000v.json.bz2 dv-2000v-wct.png
#+end_example

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 90%
[[file:dv-2000v-wct.png]]

As usual, the 50L detector only has two planes and "U" and "V" here
are simply the duplicates.

* Debugging

** FP level

Two Numpy files can be produced to assist in debugging.  An "FP" file
dumps the ~fort.xxx~ files into Numpy arrays with essentially no
processing and from it a PDF of diagnostic plots can be created.

#+begin_example
wirecell-pcbro fpstrips-fp-npz  dv-2000v.zip dv-2000v-fp.npz
wirecell-pcbro fpstrips-draw-fp dv-2000v-fp.npz dv-2000v-fp.pdf    
#+end_example

The PDF includes plots showing wire vs tick displays and per wire integration showing good normalization.

Either the ~.zip~ or this ~*-fp.npz~ file can be used in the
~convert-fpstrips~ command.

** WCT level

A similar "WCT" Numpy array may also be produced.

#+begin_example
wirecell-pcbro fpstrips-wct-npz  dv-2000v-fp.npz dv-2000v-wct.npz
#+end_example

No CLI is provided to plot this file, but one may explore it
interactively.  It may also be used as input to ~convert-fpstrips~.

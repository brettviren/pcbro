** Barf on big response

FP responses have 1196 0.1us ticks.  PIR crashes on more than 1000.

** FFT echos

FP response functions end dead right at the end of the 1196 ticks.
After snipping off the leading ticks to get 1000, WCT sim suffers,
apparently, from FFT cycling due to too-small domain.  Shifting FP
response to about 60 ticks earlier avoids this.  But, this shouldn't
be needed.



* todo

- [ ] convert FP FRs to truncated WCT FR's for 50L 2-view and isoc 3-view, expect to need 42.5us shift based on Haiwang's checks between GARFIELD and FP responses
- [ ] check FP FRs against 50-L data for time shift and normalization
  - need a real muon sim for norm

signals of the 3-view reference case:

- equilateral hole pattern
- hole spacing ~2.85mm
- 2.3 mm hole diameter
- strips oriented at 120 deg
- collection strip pitch ~ 4.9 mm
- inductions strip pitch: ~7.35 mm
- distance between the two PCB’s: 10 mm
- PCB thichness: 3.2 mm

Induction 1 is the first layer crossed by the electrons, Induction 2 is the second.
The format is the same as for the 50 liter 2view case.

** Notes

Each plane has same file ID numbers are ~fort.2xx~.  To process, tar up
each sub-dir separately 

#+begin_example
cd Reference3view
for n in collection induction1 induction2
do
  tar -cf $n.tar $n
done

wirecell-pcbro fpstrips-trio-npz \
  --col collection.tar \
  --ind1 induction1.tar \
  --ind2 induction2.tar \
  reference3view.npz

wirecell-pcbro fpstrips-draw-fp \
    reference3view.npz \
    reference3view.pdf
#+end_example

The ind1 gives:

[[file:initial-look-ind1.png]]

Looks like the induction 1 and 2 match this and past collection planes
and need a "flip".  Update ~fpstrips.fp2wct~ to do the flip on also
~"ind1"~ and ~"ind2"~ arrays.

And, also need to add support for different pitches.

#+begin_example
wirecell-pcbro convert-fpstrips \
  --pitch '7.35*mm,7.35*mm,4.9*mm' \
  reference3view.npz \
  reference3view.json.bz2
wirecell-sigproc plot-response \
  --region 0 --trange 0,125 --reflect \
  reference3view.json.bz2 \

** Sim/sigproc

Running 50L geometry with 3-view responses is a fictional but gives a
rough test.

Some tuning is likely needed to increase efficiency for the induction
planes, especially the elongated.
 
* 45 deg

this is to let you know that now in https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tfbgqrebc94ia51/AADNer78R-ff3MfbR5RPpRLoa?dl=0
there are two set of 60 deg equilateral reference cases corresponding to the following set of parameters:

    - hole spacing ~2.85mm
    - 2.3 mm hole diameter
    - strips oriented at 120 deg
    - collection strip pitch ~ 4.9 mm
    - inductions strip pitch: ~7.35 mm
    - distance between the two PCB’s: 10 mm 
    - PCB thichness: 3.2 mm

and 

    - hole spacing ~2.9mm
    - 2.4 mm hole diameter
    - strips oriented at 120 deg
    - collection strip pitch ~ 5.0 mm
    - inductions strip pitch: ~7.5 mm
    - distance between the two PCB’s: 10 mm 
    - PCB thichness: 3.2 mm
